					<h2>1. Global story about cars</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The first car was created in the year 1886 by a German inventor called Carl Benz. 
					Since then, cars have become our main source of transport, and we are still using them today. 
					The United States noticed the invention and wanted cars themselves, so they quickly replaced their old transport methods, 
					being carts and animal-drawn carriages to cars. 
					Europe and some other countries haven&apos;t become interested in cars before World War 2.

					<h2>2. What problem does this innovation solve?</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					Cars have solved a couple of things, one of them being the time to travel. 
					Cars have made traveling more accesible. And since there are roads everywhere, you could probably say that the car can take you anywhere. 
					Traveling to the store sometimes takes about a 15/20 minute walk, but with a car you can get to the store in 5 minutes. 
					For more further distances you can use the highway, on the highway you can travel at higher speeds with your car, making you able 
					to even travel to different provinces or countries. The car gives us the opportunity to travel a lot faster than we could ever do before.

					<h2>3. How to use this innovation?</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					In order to drive a car you first need to acquire your drivers license. 
					To get your drivers license you need to pass 2 exams. Your theoratical exam and your practical exam.
					You can do these exams at different companies that offer them. Getting your drivers license can be quite expensive. 
					If you fail your practical exam for example you would need to do some more lessons and redo your exam.

					<h2>4. Who is using this innovation?</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>

					Almost everyone is using this innovation. There are a lot of cars out on the streets. 
					It is hard to write down everyone that is using this innovation because of the amount. 
					So to keep a long story short we could just say that the majority of the world is using this innovation.
					But the amount of people keeps on adding up.

					<h2>5. What can you expect from the service this company is delivering?</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					It depends on which company you buy your car from. 
					There are a lot of car manufacturers out there. 
					But some companies focus more on making sports cars. 
					And some focus more on the electrical/hybrid cars. 
					The majority of car manufacturers make regular benzine/diesel cars.
					Every company has their own way of providing customer support. 
					Some will help you whatever your problem with the car is, if it&apos;s a flat tyre or a broken part.

					<h2>6. Future from this innovation</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The future looks bright for cars. With a lot of them being produced everyday. 
					And a lot of designs being made every year, there will always be growth in the car industry. 
					The cars are getting more and more eco friendly for example. The cars are using electricity instead of benzine or diesel. 
					Who knows maybe in a couple of years we all have our own flying car, flying us to anywhere we want.
